Cannot find a perfect clipboard manager so I'm writing my own. This 
tool is written with .Net 4.5 and runs on Windows.

The tool monitors system keyboard events and copies **text** from system 
clipboard when a "Copy" is performed.

###Usage

- Click on an item to copy the text to system clipboard and trigger `Ctrl+V`
- Right click an item to save it to the frequently used items list on the top
- Right click and click remove to remove the selected item
- Minimize to hide the tool to system tray
- ``Ctrl+```(ctrl+backtick) or Ctrl+Space to bring the tool up
- Clicking on an item also hide the tool to system tray
